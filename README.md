Master's thesis

To do:
1. High-level SciPy prototype (if case you need a reference implementation)
2. Purely NumPy-implemented prototype
3. Prototype based on PyTorch (make sure that things are differentiable)
4. Fully functional layer implemented in PyTorch

experimental pipeline:
1. Data loading
2. Data split (training/validation/testing)
3. Model training (with logs and snapshots)
4. Model evaluation
