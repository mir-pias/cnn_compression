DCT_layer -> LinearDCT -> old DCT linear implementation, working
DCT_conv_layer -> same -> old DCT convolution implementation, somewhat working (?) -> nope, increases trainable params, not working

ConvDCT -> new DCT convolution implementation, working 
DCT_linear_layer -> new DCT linear implementation, not working

jupyter notebooks -> not/somewhat working (?) implementations, new linear and old conv -> no more updates from now
py files -> working implementations, old linear and new conv -> only conv

changed network names 

for AlexnetLinearDCT/DST, replacing the classification layer gives better acc, but not for AlexnetDCT/DST
